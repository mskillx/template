# Vertical Scroll Application - Next.js Frontend & Django Backend

This application combines a Next.js frontend with a Django backend to create a vertically scrolling experience with integrated application components.  The frontend provides the user interface, while the backend handles data and logic.

## Overview

The application aims to provide a seamless and engaging user experience through a vertical scrolling layout.  Integrated application components (e.g., forms, interactive elements) are presented as the user scrolls down the page.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you up and running with the application.

### Prerequisites

*   **Node.js (v18 or higher):**  For the Next.js frontend.  Download from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **Python (3.10 or higher):** For the Django backend.  Download from [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/)
*   **npm or yarn:**  Package managers for Node.js.  npm comes with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url>
    cd <your_repository_directory>
    ```

2.  **Frontend (Next.js):**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Backend (Django):**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python -m venv venv  # Create a virtual environment (recommended)
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Architecture

The application follows a clear separation of concerns:

*   **Frontend (Next.js):**
    *   Handles user interface rendering and interaction.
    *   Communicates with the backend via API calls (typically `fetch` or `axios`).
    *   State management (e.g., using React Context, Redux, Zustand - specify your choice).
*   **Backend (Django):**
    *   Provides API endpoints for the frontend to consume.
    *   Handles data persistence (e.g., using a database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
    *   Implements business logic and authentication.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Frontend:** Next.js, React, JavaScript/TypeScript (specify your choice), CSS/styled-components/emotion (specify your choice).
*   **Backend:** Django, Django REST Framework (DRF - if using APIs), Python.
*   **Communication:**  HTTP/JSON (usually).

## Running the Application

1.  **Backend (Django):**

    *   Migrate the database:

        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```

    *   Run the development server:

        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

        (The server will usually run on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`)

2.  **Frontend (Next.js):**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev  # or yarn dev
    ```

    (The server will usually run on `http://localhost:3000/`)

## API Endpoints

*(List your API endpoints here.  This is extremely important for developers to understand how the frontend interacts with the backend.  Example:)*

*   `GET /api/data`: Retrieves data for the vertical scroll sections.
*   `POST /api/form-submission`: Handles form submissions from the frontend.

## Deployment

*(Provide deployment instructions here. This section is highly dependent on your chosen deployment platforms. Examples:)*

*   **Frontend (Next.js):** Vercel, Netlify, AWS Amplify, etc.
*   **Backend (Django):** Heroku, AWS EC2, Google Cloud Run, DigitalOcean, etc.

*(Mention any special considerations for deploying the application as a single unit, e.g., using Docker.)*
